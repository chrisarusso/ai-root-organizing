Web Modernization & 
Future Readiness Proposal
READING IS FUNDAMENTAL  SAVAS LABS
December 18, 2025


Executive Summary 
Given Savas Labs’ deep, established partnership with Reading Is Fundamental and our first-hand understanding of your 
audiences, content, and digital ecosystem, we are well positioned to further strengthen our partnership and advance RIF’s 
modernization and future readiness goals. Through prior strategy and delivery work, including rebuilding Skybrary and 
supporting multiple discovery and planning phases that informed this RFP, we are able to build on shared understanding and 
momentum, focusing on execution and impact rather than needing to establish context.  
Our approach centers on strengthening how RIF’s technical architecture, data, and content are structured, discovered, and 
experienced across RIF.org, Literacy Central, and Literacy Network. By thoughtfully streamlining and unifying these systems 
where they deliver the most value, we will improve clarity, navigation, and performance while ensuring RIF’s most important 
resources are easier to produce at high quality and more readily accessible for educators, families, partners, and funders.
As part of the strategy phase, we are excited to offer at no cost our AI Readiness and Opportunity Assessment to ignite RIF’s 
long-standing goal of becoming a more AI-forward organization, while preparing your data, processes, and teams to take 
advantage in the near, medium, and long-term. The assessment will identify practical, responsible ways AI can improve 
content discoverability, organization, and engagement, while also increasing the efficiency and quality of internal workflows 
through a steadfast, human-centered approach. With a clearer foundation, shared priorities, and organizational readiness, 
RIF will be better positioned to extend the reach and relevance of its content and people, and to translate those strengths into 
measurable impact using the most powerful, modern tools. 
We can’t wait to get started!

UNC Charlotte
Objective:
The Universityʼs decentralized digital ecosystem—spanning more than 600 domains 
and subdomains—lacked consistency in branding, usability, and governance. 
Without a shared framework, individual sites diverged from brand standards, 
resulting in fragmented experiences and a diluted institutional presence.
Approach:
We created a flexible design system grounded in atomic design principles, including 
a comprehensive component library and a Content Creator Guide. Our system was 
built based on user research, analytical insights and extensive stakeholder 
workshops. Together, these tools provide clear standards and governance while 
enabling distributed teams to build cohesive, on-brand sites independently.
Results:
While the system continues to roll out across the University, early adoption has 
already delivered meaningful results. Teams now have a system that streamlines 
content creation and adheres to brand standards. This has accelerated site 
development and established a scalable foundation for ongoing growth. The 
success of this approach has led to continued collaboration, with Savas Labs now 
supporting the University across 14 projects and counting.

Strategy & Planning
SECTION 3

Stakeholder Workshops 
STRATEGY & PLANNING
Stakeholder workshops are designed to align RIFʼs internal teams around shared goals, clarify priorities, and 
inform key strategic decisions before design and development begin. These collaborative sessions allow us to 
gather input across audiences, content, and technical considerations, validate assumptions, and surface 
opportunities and constraints early in the process. Insights from these workshops will directly inform 
recommendations related to user journeys, content strategy, information architecture, and platform structure, 
helping ensure the resulting solutions are well aligned with RIFʼs mission, operational realities, and long-term 
digital goals.
DELIVERABLES
● RIF Donor Pages Partner Journey - Evaluates and improves the donor and partner experience across RIFʼs 
branded donor pages, with alignment on goals and partnership storytelling.
● Literacy Central Strategy & Experience - Aligns on Literacy Centralʼs role as the primary hub for educators 
and families, focusing on content organization, taxonomy, and experience design.
● Literacy Network Strategy - Aligns stakeholders on the future role of Literacy Network through a shared 
evaluation of consolidation into Literacy Central versus maintaining a streamlined standalone presence.
● Unified Search Strategy - Examines how users discover content across RIFʼs digital properties and evaluates 
the value of a unified search experience across all three verticals.


Metrics & Competitor Benchmarking
STRATEGY & PLANNING
DELIVERABLES
● Baseline User Metrics
● Baseline Search & Discovery 
Metrics
● Competitor Benchmarking
We will focus on establishing a clear performance baseline 
across RIFʼs three digital verticals to inform decision-making 
and measure success over time. We will review existing 
analytics and reporting to establish baseline metrics for new 
and returning users, engagement, and key behavioral 
indicators, providing support where needed to ensure metrics 
are consistently defined across platforms. We will also analyze 
how users are discovering each vertical, including traditional 
channels such as organic search and referrals, as well as 
emerging AI-assisted discovery patterns, to better understand 
acquisition and entry points. In parallel, we will conduct a 
competitive benchmarking analysis against comparable 
education resource platforms, including ReadWorks and 
CommonLit, to contextualize RIFʼs performance and identify 
opportunities to strengthen reach, engagement, and 
discoverability.

Page Inventory & Content Mapping
STRATEGY & PLANNING
DELIVERABLES
● Page inventory
● Duplicate content pruning
● Content reorganization
● Content migration plan
This phase focuses on creating a clear, actionable 
understanding of RIFʼs existing content across all three 
verticals. We will inventory current pages to identify 
duplication, gaps, and opportunities for consolidation, while 
working with stakeholders to determine what content should be 
retained, updated, reorganized, or retired. Insights from this 
work will inform a practical content reorganization and 
migration plan that supports improved discoverability, clearer 
user journeys, and a more maintainable CMS moving forward.

Roadmap Delivery
STRATEGY & PLANNING
DELIVERABLES
● Product Roadmap 
○ Feature Prioritization
○ Project Schedule & Delivery Plan
Bringing together insights from stakeholder workshops, metrics 
analysis, and content planning, we will deliver a clear, 
actionable product roadmap that translates strategy into 
execution. The roadmap will clearly distinguish must-have 
requirements from nice-to-have enhancements across all three 
verticals, helping align priorities, manage tradeoffs, and ensure 
the project is delivered on time and within budget. This 
roadmap will serve as a shared reference point for sequencing, 
resourcing, and implementation planning moving forward.

Global Implementation

DELIVERABLES
● Information Architecture
● Sitemap
● Navigation & Footer
Building on the page inventory and content mapping work, we 
will redesign the information architecture to ensure content 
across all three verticals is organized in a clear, intuitive, and 
audience-focused way. This work will focus on defining logical 
content groupings, reducing duplication, and clarifying how 
users navigate between and within verticals. Updates to the 
sitemap, navigation, and footer will reflect these decisions, 
helping users quickly find relevant content while reinforcing 
each verticalʼs role within the broader RIF ecosystem and 
supporting long-term scalability and maintainability.

Single Sign-on
GLOBAL IMPLEMENTATION
PROPERTIES TO BE UPDATED
● Literacy Central
● Literacy Network
DELIVERABLES
● SSO strategy and recommendation
● SSO integration
● Unified authentication across 
platforms
Unifying authentication across Literacy Central, Literacy Network, and 
Literacy Tracker is a key opportunity to simplify the user experience, 
reduce account duplication, and improve data consistency across 
platforms. Rather than requiring users to manage multiple accounts, a 
shared SSO approach will allow educators and related audiences to 
access RIF tools through a single, familiar login, while giving RIF a 
clearer, more centralized view of user activity and engagement.
Based on our technical assessment, we recommend implementing 
Google Workspace SSO using OpenID Connect OIDC) rather than 
integrating directly with Google Classroom. While Google Classroom is 
widely used by educators, it is not an identity provider and does not 
provide additional SSO value unless roster or coursework 
synchronization is required, which would significantly expand scope. 
Google Workspace authentication provides a standards-based, 
scalable solution that integrates cleanly with Drupal 10 and supports 
unification across all three properties, while still aligning with RIFʼs goal 
of leveraging tools educators already use.

To support a fast, reliable user experience across all three 
verticals, we will assess current site performance using 
industry-standard tools such as Google Lighthouse. This 
assessment will focus on Core Web Vitals and related 
performance indicators to identify opportunities to improve 
page speed, responsiveness, and stability. Findings from this 
report will inform targeted recommendations for performance 
enhancements and provide a foundation for ongoing monitoring 
and continuous improvement.


Security Plan 
GLOBAL IMPLEMENTATION
PROPERTIES TO BE UPDATED
● RIF.org
● Literacy Central
● Literacy Network
DELIVERABLES
● Security Plan & Recommendations
● Solution Implementation
To support a stable and reliable digital ecosystem, we will 
define a security approach that protects RIFʼs digital properties 
while preserving access for legitimate users and approved 
agents. A key focus will be addressing unwanted automated 
traffic and other security risks without introducing unnecessary 
friction for educators, partners, or systems that require access. 
The goal is to establish a clear, security baseline that can 
evolve as needs change.
Our initial recommendation is a phased implementation of 
Cloudflare, starting with the free tier to provide immediate 
improvements in traffic visibility, baseline bot mitigation, CDN 
support, and DDoS protection. This approach allows RIF to 
quickly improve protection and observe traffic patterns, with a 
clear path to more advanced controls such as rate limiting, 
enhanced bot management, and agent allowlisting if additional 
safeguards become necessary.

● Drupal 11 Readiness Assessment 
● Core and Module Updates
● Post-Upgrade Validation
Our first step will be to run a Drupal 11 readiness and status 
check across all three sites to identify deprecated modules, 
custom code impacts, and any potential blockers. Assuming no 
blocking issues or higher-priority constraints, we recommend 
completing the Drupal 11 upgrade early in the engagement to 
reduce technical debt and streamline downstream design and 
development work.

Updates
Building on insights from our strategy work and prior audits, we 
will focus on improving discoverability, performance, and 
content quality across all three verticals. This includes 
prioritizing and executing technical SEO fixes already identified, 
while ensuring the CMS and content entry experience support 
long-term SEO and GEO best practices without introducing 
technical or taxonomical debt. Improvements will emphasize 
mobile-first performance, accessibility, and structured content 
to better support both traditional search and emerging 
AI-driven discovery.
At the CMS and theme level, this work will include establishing 
default metadata, enabling per-page metadata control, and 
addressing critical heading hierarchy and structural issues to 
ensure consistency and scalability. Together, these updates will 
help ensure RIFʼs content is easier to manage, easier to 
discover, and positioned for ongoing optimization.

RIF.ORG | DONOR PAGES
DELIVERABLES
● User Journey Mapping
● Conversion Optimization
● Up to 3 New Components
● Page Layout Updates
○ Partner With Us
○ Corporate Partners
○ Foundation Partners
○ Case Studies
Building on the SEO and content audit work completed in 
TO03, we will revisit and refine the corporate and foundation 
partner journey to increase qualified traffic and improve 
conversion. This work focuses on clarifying messaging, 
strengthening storytelling, and optimizing key partnership 
pages to better support discovery, engagement, and 
submissions to the development team. Updates may include 
refreshed layouts and targeted component enhancements 
designed to better highlight partner impact and guide users

Interactive Map
RIF.ORG | DONOR PAGES
DELIVERABLES
● Interactive Map
● Individual Region/State Detail Page 
Template Single page, content 
implementation not included)
● Literacy Statistic Page Layout
A better interactive map might present the following at both a 
national and regional level: statistics about the literacy crisis; 
RIFs impact as measured through program sites, books 
distributed, children impacted, advocates activated; as well as 
RIF-led events. Weʼll explore the data we have access to 
through Salesforce and other sources, determine the most 
effective way to use and present it, as well as implement it.
As an addition to the map, we will create individual pages at 
either the regional or state level to further break down literacy 
statistics, program details and other ways to get involved.


Literacy Central
SECTION 6

Browsing & UX Enhancements
LITERACY CENTRAL
DELIVERABLES
● View Components
● Book & Resource Card Component
● Page layout updates
● Filter Functionality & UI Update
● Backend Development &
Resource Remapping
Building on the Discovery work already completed for Literacy 
Central, we will refine how resources are organized and presented 
to support a more intuitive, education-centric browsing experience. 
This includes finalizing a condensed set of Genres and Themes, 
refining filtering behavior, and programmatically remapping 
resources to improve clarity and findability. We will also introduce 
curated Collections that group resources around themes, audiences, 
or moments, supporting both everyday discovery and the automated 
promotion of timely content tied to holidays, special events, and 
national moments.
In parallel, we will identify opportunities to modernize the existing 
theme and introduce targeted layout and component updates where 
needed to better support priority user groups. This work may also 
include strengthening connections between related resources, such 
as interactive puzzle pages, to help students move through content 
more easily without direct adult support.




AI-Powered Resource Generation
LITERACY CENTRAL
DELIVERABLES
● Customize AI Tool
● Testing for Alternative Book-related 
Content
Many of the books in Skybrary and Literacy Central are missing 
supplemental resources such as word searches, crosswords, 
and memory-matching activities. As part of this work, we can 
explore the usefulness to RIF to leverage AI tools to efficiently 
generate this type of content at scale, helping expand RIFʼs 
resource library without placing additional burden on staff. This 
exploration would focus on integrating AI into internal 
workflows rather than user-facing experiences, and could lay 
the groundwork for future applications such as user-generated 
vocabulary sets, lesson plans, and discussion or 
comprehension questions.


User Journey Mapping
LITERACY CENTRAL
DELIVERABLES
● Homepage Redesign
● Families Page Layout
● Teachers Page Layout
● Volunteers Page Layout
In addition to revamping the browsing experience of the 
Resource Hub which is agnostic to the audience that is using it, 
we would also like to take a closer look at how we could curate 
a more customized experience for Families, Teachers and 
Volunteers. This would include revamping the homepage and 
individual pages that specifically target our individual 
audiences.


Training & Resources
LITERACY CENTRAL
DELIVERABLES
● Professional Development Hub
● Training resource migration
● Webinar content organization
We will consolidate training and professional development 
resources into Literacy Central, establishing it as the primary 
hub for teachers and families seeking guidance on how to use 
RIFʼs resources effectively. This includes migrating professional 
development content, primarily webinars, from Literacy 
Network and redesigning how these materials are organized 
and delivered so users can engage with them intuitively and at 
their own pace.
The Professional Development Hub will be designed to support 
a growing library of video-based content and position Literacy 
Central as a repeat destination for educators. The structure will 
be built with scalability in mind, allowing RIF to evolve this hub 
over time and explore future enhancements, including 
AI-supported content experiences, as priorities and tools 
mature.


Search Enhancements
LITERACY CENTRAL
DELIVERABLES
● Search Functionality Updates
● UI Updates
● Refreshed Search Results Page
● AI-assisted Search Recommendations
Improving search is a key opportunity to help users quickly find 
relevant resources and better support discovery-driven 
browsing across Literacy Central. Building on recommendations 
from the Discovery Phase, we will enhance search functionality 
to deliver more intuitive, relevant results informed by content 
structure, taxonomy, and user intent. To help ground this 
conversation, we have included an early search experience 
mockup alongside this proposal to illustrate potential directions 
and inform discussion during discovery.
As part of this effort, we will also explore the potential for 
AI-assisted search experiences trained on RIFʼs content library, 
including web content, PDFs, presentations, and video 
resources. Any AI-supported enhancements would be 
considered in the context of usability, scalability, and value, 
with recommendations aligned to RIFʼs goals and readiness.




Registered Users | Feature Enhancements
LITERACY CENTRAL
DELIVERABLES
● Define Registered Users Features
● Detailed Estimates & 
Implementation Plan
● Account registration conversion 
pathways
● Newsletter sign-up optimization
Registered user functionality presents an opportunity to deepen 
engagement and better support how educators and families use 
and share resources. We will evaluate ways to enhance 
registered user experiences so teachers and educators can 
more easily curate and share resources with parents, and 
support more structured learning pathways for children. In 
parallel, we will define and optimize conversion pathways for 
account registration and newsletter sign-ups, exploring how 
existing and new tools such as the Puzzle Maker and Literacy 
Tracker can be leveraged as incentives to encourage account 
creation.


Multilingual Features
LITERACY CENTRAL
Supporting multilingual access is an important consideration for Literacy Central, both to better serve diverse 
audiences and to meet partner requirements. We will evaluate scalable approaches for enabling translation across 
Drupal-managed content, with an emphasis on solutions that are sustainable, editor-friendly, and able to grow over 
time. This work will build on RIFʼs current use of WeGlot for select pages and explore whether multilingual support 
should be expanded more broadly across the site.
We will outline and assess two primary approaches, highlighting trade offs related to scalability, editorial control, 
long-term flexibility, and integration with future enhancements such as AI-powered search. While the primary focus 
will be Drupal-stored content, we can also explore options for extending translation support to PDFs, presentations, 
and video transcripts as a future consideration.
OPTIONS
● Drupal Native Multilingual + Machine Translation Recommended) - Leverages Drupalʼs core multilingual 
capabilities combined with machine translation, allowing translated content to live directly in the CMS and remain 
fully editable by site editors. This approach prioritizes long-term scalability, editorial control, and flexibility.
● Weglot SaaSBased Translation Layer) - Extends RIFʼs existing WeGlot usage to additional pages or the full site, 
enabling fast rollout with minimal Drupal configuration, but with translations managed outside the CMS and 
increasing costs as content volume grows.


Literacy Network
SECTION 7

Option 1: Theme Installation 
& Content Migration
LITERACY NETWORK
DELIVERABLES
● Theme Installation
● Remapping of Content Migration)
● Content Pruning Archiving legacy 
content that is no longer needed)
Following the strategy phase, we will have a clear path forward 
for Literacy Network. This option keeps Literacy Network a 
distinct property within RIFʼs digital ecosystem, focused on 
volunteers, program implementers, and community partners. 
Building on prior discovery work, we would modernize Literacy 
Network by importing the existing RIF.org donor pages theme, 
with the option to apply a differentiated child identity or color 
palette to maintain visual distinction while aligning with the 
broader ecosystem.
Existing content would be audited, cleaned up, and migrated 
into the updated theme, with only priority pages and workflows 
carried forward. The result is a more maintainable, clearly 
scoped vertical that improves the content editing experience 
for internal teams while preserving Literacy Networkʼs unique 
role.


User Journey Mapping & IA
LITERACY NETWORK
DELIVERABLES
● User Journey Mapping
● Navigation Updates
● Content Strategy
● Up to 8 Page Layouts
Once the content mapping exercise has been completed for all 
three entities the Literacy Network site would benefit from 
doing a workshop to establish User Journeys for its core 
audience members. This can be a relatively light lift and will 
impact the page layouts for the priority pages of the website. 
We will revisit the navigation structure to match the newly 
created content model and better serve your target audiences. 
The next step will be to create up to 8 new page layouts 
leveraging the newly installed theme from RIF.org to improve 
the user experience for your users.


Option 2: Consolidate Literacy Network 
into Literacy Central
LITERACY NETWORK
DELIVERABLES
● Literacy Network Content 
Consolidation
● Dedicated Literacy Network 
Landing Page
● Content Pruning Archiving legacy 
content that is no longer needed)
● Content migration into Literacy 
Central
● Navigation and IA updates within 
Literacy Central
Under this option, Literacy Network would be sunset as a 
standalone site, with its highest-value content and functionality 
integrated into Literacy Central. Content supporting volunteers, 
program implementers, and community partners would be 
reorganized and incorporated into existing or new sections 
within Literacy Central, with a dedicated landing page to 
highlight key resources and entry points for these audiences.
This approach reduces platform complexity, simplifies ongoing 
maintenance, and clarifies user pathways by consolidating 
educator- and volunteer-focused content into a single, more 
discoverable hub. It also eliminates the need to maintain a 
separate site and associated navigation, theming, and 
authentication, allowing future enhancements to focus on a 
unified platform.


QA & Launch 
SECTION 8

Training & Documentation
QA & LAUNCH
DELIVERABLES
● Editor Training Session
● Developer Handoff & 
Documentation
● CMS Guide & Documentation
● Governance Guide
To support a smooth launch and long-term success, we will 
provide clear training and documentation for both RIFʼs 
engineering and content teams. Training sessions will focus on 
using the CMS effectively, including managing components and 
templates, creating and updating content, and understanding 
key workflows. In parallel, we will deliver concise 
documentation covering editorial guidelines, governance 
considerations, and technical reference materials to help RIF 
confidently maintain and evolve the platform over time.


Quality Assurance 
QA & LAUNCH
DELIVERABLES
● QA test plan
● WCAG accessibility validation
● Functional and regression testing
● Cross-browser and device testing
Quality assurance will be treated as a defined, documented 
workstream to ensure launch readiness across all three 
verticals. We will develop a concise QA test plan and execute 
structured testing across key user, editorial, and administrative 
workflows to reduce risk and ensure stability. This process will 
include functional testing, regression testing, and 
cross-browser/device validation, with a specific emphasis on 
meeting WCAG accessibility standards.
Testing results will be tracked, validated, and resolved through 
a clear issue management process, culminating in final 
pre-launch smoke testing and QA sign-off to support a 
confident launch.


Post-Launch Support
QA & LAUNCH
DELIVERABLES
● Post-launch bug fixes
● Issue resolution and stabilization
● Launch monitoring
● Long-term support planning 
discussion
Following launch, we will provide 3060 days of post-launch 
support focused on addressing bugs, resolving issues, and 
ensuring the platform is operating as expected. This period 
allows time to monitor performance, validate real-world usage, 
and make any necessary adjustments as users begin 
interacting with the site.
As part of this phase, we can also collaborate with RIF to review 
longer-term support and maintenance options, aligning on an 
approach that best supports ongoing needs, priorities, and 
capacity.

Assumptions
SCHEDULE & PRICING
Sharing a proposed approach for a project 
before working together naturally comes 
with a host of assumptions. We have 
enumerated them from our perspective to 
ensure we align on any areas of uncertainty 
before getting started together.
Copywriting
Estimates do not include copywriting or content creation. We 
can provide copy support and separate estimates if needed.
Technical Audits
Based on the strategy work completed to date, additional 
technical audits have not been included. We can reassess if 
new risks or requirements are identified. 
Media Types & Multi-Modal Content
The platform will be structured to support additional media 
types in the future. Specific implementation of audio, 
text-to-speech, or other multi-modal formats is not included 
and would be scoped separately. 
Literacy Network Direction
Estimates assume Literacy Network remains a standalone site. 
Consolidating Literacy Network into Literacy Central may shift 
scope and effort across workstreams and will be evaluated 
early in strategy and planning.


Assumptions
SCHEDULE & PRICING
 Drupal Upgrade Scope
Assumes upgrading all three sites to the latest version of 
Drupal as part of the engagement.
Competitor Benchmarking & Metrics
Assumes access to existing analytics and reporting (e.g., 
Google Analytics) to establish baseline metrics and support 
competitor benchmarking.
Semantic Search Enhancements
Assumes integrating semantic search into existing site, with 
AILLM enhancements to be determined in partnership with 
RIF in strategy phase. 

We look forward to 
partnering with you.
Reading Is Fundamental is seeking a partner who can help translate the impact of your work 
into a digital experience that is clear, credible, and built for the future. At Savas Labs, weʼre 
excited for the opportunity to collaborate with your team and bring that vision to life. Our 
approach prioritizes alignment, transparency, thoughtful design, and sustainable technology, 
ensuring the new site not only reflects who you are today, but supports the evolution of your 
mission for years to come. We look forward to working closely together to create a platform 
that strengthens how the world engages with RIFʼs vital work.
