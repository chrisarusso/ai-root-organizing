## Key Learnings

**Cost Optimization:**
- Batching = 90% savings (200 msgs/call vs one-at-a-time)
- Embeddings are cheap ($0.58 for 700K messages)
- Filter before processing (cheap heuristics reduce expensive LLM calls)
- Use cheaper models (GPT-4o-mini for classification, premium for synthesis)

**RAG Insights:**
- RAG excels at: "What did X say about Y?" (topic-specific retrieval)
- RAG struggles with: "What kind of person is X?" (requires reasoning across patterns)
- Pre-shape data (10-15% of messages reveal personality)
- Evidence linking builds trust (always link to source material)

**Real-World Validation:**
- Website analyzer caught real errors: "ROT"→"ROI", client misspellings, broken taxonomy
- Personality extraction validated by team members
- Different LLMs generate different perspectives (comparison = value)
