## Priority Action Items

**Next steps to work on - drag to reorder by priority**

- [ ] **GEO/AEO optimization** - depth of understanding. Make updates for Savas
-  Go back through proposals and recorded conversations with prospects to craft specifc email follow up to re-engage
-  I should be able to load all slack history, teamwork.com, and transcripts, and google docs, to verify what the scope should be 
  - should be able to give directory in Drive
- Need to claude set up and use playwright to have it check things and have that be part of the agent  
- Try to upsell APC on new AI offerings -- do full scan of site, but show that it's an AI add-on with GEO/AEO
- [ ] **Create Lab for Secret Savas** Also, spin down server
- [ ] **Publish Google Drive automation blog** - 2-3 hrs - Medium impact for expertise
- [ ] **Website Quality SaaS - build web UI** - 2-3 weeks - High impact, new revenue stream
- [ ] **Document quality coach** - 1-2 weeks - High impact for internal efficiency
- [ ] **LinkedIn video snippets** - 1 day - Medium impact for brand awareness
- [ ] **Case study: RIF web modernization** - 1 week - Medium impact for sales
- [ ] **Multi-source knowledge base** - 4-6 weeks - Very high impact for sales context
- [ ] **Automated website monitoring agent** - 3-4 weeks - High impact, potential SaaS
- [ ] **Client-specific SLM training research** - Unknown effort - Very high differentiation
- [ ] Review YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfDvkSkelhg
- [ ] Review old ideas from Jake
- [ ] Review old ideas with Doug
- [ ] Google Drive API scan for ideas
- [ ] Evernote review for archived ideas
- [ ] Retrieval Agents PDF - OCR and process
- [ ] Internal marketing workflow automation | 🔵 | Internal | Just about easily tagging things to store somewhere - Podcast, blog, social workflows |
	-  Content curation system | ⚪ | Internal | Tag/save YouTube videos, podcasts, articles |
-  Do deeply discounted AI audit work to get it under our belt, especially if it doesn’t work out with RIF or Atlantic Council
-  https://docs.google.com/document/d/18sjiaxiYg-gn_O30ATnDaYq78bLhdCkNFquFaixCzHY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.f06f0jsy7k90 -- have standard prompts (should probably be in markdown files in github -- but do something with all the ways we reuse LLMs)
-  Determine plans for Grogo 
-  Determine plans for Fuqua pitch
-  Better workflow to run some background claude/cursor remotely cursor.com/agents for allowing YOLO -- build this whole app and take an hour or whatever
-  Getting my vibe code workflow down. Probably could use prompts better, lik ethe cursor vp of dev youtube video -- he's got a subset -- and just make sure it's always making passwords and shit easy, and that I learn how to do worktree and commits well
-  Perhaps do _something_ with https://commoncrawl.org/
-  Review if there's anything worth picking back up from SF retreat
-     Check Google Antigravity
- Regarding content calendar: reminder to reuse past things
- Look into RIF competitors and if what we build for RIF, they could use
- Finalize content workflow on how to do so efficientlly, super systematic, all the steps, including asking people to like.
- Host events in SF at our office, target is prospective clients, non-technical, maybe we can have a good use case for each of the subcategories of our things by then, and record somehow (with tripod) and add that to content on the page – and offer it for low-cost for local organizations maybe – would be good for content 
- 	Need to do a Labs project that shows meaningful AI and maybe some really slick front-end stuff so we can show people it as case study
-  Why were models trained on all of the internet and not just books and newspapers? Not even digitized data? Internet’s better? Seems there’s enough data, and better quality/structured in books/newspapers, but probably not as digitally accessible?

## Research & Learning

**Topics to deepen knowledge - move research items here**

| Topic | Output/Outcome/Use Case |
|-------|-------------------------|
| Cost optimization for RAG at scale | Reduce costs when expanding to millions of messages, inform client pricing |
| Embedding strategies (local vs API) | Choose best approach for different project sizes/budgets |
| Chunking strategies for RAG | Improve retrieval quality, handle context preservation |
| ReAct agent architecture | Build autonomous agents that reason and take action |
| Private/fine-tuned models | Understand feasibility and cost for client-specific models |
| Evals | Understanding/describing/using |
| Why front-end code is harder | Need to better understand why we can't show a figma and it build that easily |

## Marketing & Content

How to really fully maximize content reach when creating a piece, and how to be thoughtful of how to ensure we optimize sharing

How to processize this and make sure I or someone follows this each time we create content

Remember to post to all possible places:

- Bureau
- Founder’s Club
- Alliance of CEOs (maybe that’s just LinkedIn)
- Any other Slack communities? 
- Any other AI / local SF stuff?
- Shack 15 WhatsApp
- Should use Buffer to schedule
- Should schedule Slack messages for internal

## Ideas List

| Idea | Status | Type | Notes |
|------|--------|------|-------|
| Secret Savas - Slack RAG personality analyzer | 🟢 | Internal | 700K msgs, $0.50/user, blog ready, `savas-scripts/not/RAG-test-Slack/` |
| Client-specific SLM training / private find-tuned models | 🔵 | Product | Train small language models with client context (RIF example), beyond RAG |
| Website scraper / quality analyzer | 🟡 | Internal | Be exhaustive on all the things it could check: Spelling/SEO/WCAG/security, caught real bugs. Forbes misspelling on that page - ai billionaires  Crawl4AI for research/content curation  Scraper: https://chatgpt.com/c/6920031a-3b08-8327-9326-4550cdb53cd0 I also just found that the taxonomy term for AI is not checked in the view – so it fails when you go to it 🤦  – this should be added to the screening tool – clicks everything and finds non-standard behavior. Maybe we ca provide some sort of service that an agent can update the site and document the fixes it’s made, and charge for that service as a monthly subscription or something I could imagine it having permission to log into the Drupal site, fixing the typo, documenting it, and  Things like typos maybe don’t recur a bunch, but people not adding  What about an agent that can login to a Drupal/WordPress site – it’s interesting 🤔 Maybe the agent does thee update on your staging site and runs some other tests and takes a screenshot so you can just quickly approve the update. Could also be triggered on any site change. |
| Document quality analyzer | 🔴 | Internal | Pre-review proposals/kickoffs for Lu/Zakk Task Orders -- check against spelling, spacing, grammar, other quality metrics.  `proposal-submission-workflow/` -- did some work there |
| Meeting/idea scoring system | 🔵 | Internal | Score meetings/ideas against criteria (from Striver) |
| Weekly Slack update meeting order agent | 🟢 | Internal | Airtable + Slack MCP server + Google Calendar |
| Drupal/WordPress update agent | 🔵 | Internal | Auto-test staging, visual regression / HTML comparison (should be able to do for all pages easily enough), create PRs, verify form submissions (contact still works). Minor version test and then move to major version |
| Proposal/task order automation of creation, there are services, but how do we make custom design look good and be readily buildable | 🔵 | Internal | Template generation, `proposal-submission-workflow/` |
| LLM-assisted content categorization | 🔵 | Internal | Auto-tag/categorize large content libraries - could do an update to Savas's shitty tagging, both looking for all our tags, suggesting reduction, anything with fewer than 3 -- anyhting that's a subset, going to higher category |
| Multi-source knowledge base (Savas unified search) | 🔴 | Internal | Slack + Drive + GitHub + Harvest + Teamwork + Fathom, single search interface - need to be thoughtful/clear about use cases but demoing searchability AND auto-triggers on things that matter that we might want to be alerted about -- connected to document quality checking automation |
| Some sort of sell-asssments demo | 🔴 | Internal | Kirsten's idea, maybe it couples with the scraper and you get some brief insights - Kirsten’s tool – maybe we can LLM-ify crawling someone’s site – looking for typos as an example, and also assessing if it’s LLM ready https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/hugging-face-ceo-says-were-in-an-llm-bubble-not-an-ai-bubble/  |
| Agents searching how to make site run leaner (DB queries) | 🔴 | Internal | Ways to automatically / programmatically check opportunities to reduce bloat so I don’t have to pay more for Drupal site on Platform.sh / Upsun Can it scour and see files, and look for things that are no longer referenced from the site, or bloaty-y ass tables|
| Prospect researcher bot | 🔴 | Internal | A bot that can scrape twitter, give sentiment, and recommend what that decision maker would like to hear in a proposal Could be broader scrape of all public internet – could be for sales too HubSpot and Salesforce must have really sophisticated tools for this, scraping all sorts of things about sentiment, personality, buying advice on individuals. I wonder 🤔 – maybe it’d be bad to be in that system though |
| speeding up case study generation | 🔴 | Internal | It would be nice to vibe that up fast, reducing the time it takes us, so we'd get them out more quickly |
| going from strategic proposal time to kickoff | 🔴 | Internal | should determine/reuse stuff from sales when moving to kickoff |
| Psychiatry | 🔴 | Internal | – who’s creating data for RL – video (sentiment), plus audio (sentiment), plus transcript |
| Quickbooks sucks,  | 🔴 | Internal | and that should be AI-able, and be like $10/month and allow me to just quickly scan and verify. No email with my person. Would be easy to view old transactions and how they’re cat |
