## Priority Action Items

**Next steps to work on - drag to reorder by priority**

- [ ] **GEO/AEO optimization** - depth of understanding. Make updates for Savas
- Make sure LinkedIn and other notifications are coming to my phone
- Also, how can I automate voice memos into my todos for savas and have suggestions to make it easy to accept/build
- Need to figure out the best way to write emails in my tone, and automate those with one-click approvals
- Develop list in addition to marketing contacts to send AI Readiness Asseessment (existing clients/prospects)
- Design tools/leadership: https://savas-labs.monday.com/boards/8980628899/pulses/8922398946
-  Go back through proposals and recorded conversations with prospects to craft specifc email follow up to re-engage
-  I should be able to load all slack history, teamwork.com, and transcripts, and google docs, to verify what the scope should be 
  - should be able to give directory in Drive
- Need to claude set up and use playwright to have it check things and have that be part of the agent  
- Learn how to use openrouter for cheaper stuff
- Try to upsell APC on new AI offerings -- do full scan of site, but show that it's an AI add-on with GEO/AEO
- [ ] **Create Lab for Secret Savas** Also, spin down server
- [ ] **Publish Google Drive automation blog** - 2-3 hrs - Medium impact for expertise
- [ ] **Website Quality SaaS - build web UI** - 2-3 weeks - High impact, new revenue stream
- [ ] **Document quality coach** - 1-2 weeks - High impact for internal efficiency
- [ ] **LinkedIn video snippets** - 1 day - Medium impact for brand awareness
- [ ] **Case study: RIF web modernization** - 1 week - Medium impact for sales
- [ ] **Multi-source knowledge base** - 4-6 weeks - Very high impact for sales context
- [ ] **Automated website monitoring agent** - 3-4 weeks - High impact, potential SaaS
- [ ] **Client-specific SLM training research** - Unknown effort - Very high differentiation
- [ ] Review YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfDvkSkelhg
- [ ] Review old ideas from Jake
- [ ] Review old ideas with Doug
- [ ] Google Drive API scan for ideas
- [ ] Evernote review for archived ideas
- [ ] Retrieval Agents PDF - OCR and process
- [ ] Internal marketing workflow automation | 🔵 | Internal | Just about easily tagging things to store somewhere - Podcast, blog, social workflows |
	-  Content curation system | ⚪ | Internal | Tag/save YouTube videos, podcasts, articles |
-  Do deeply discounted AI audit work to get it under our belt, especially if it doesn’t work out with RIF or Atlantic Council
-  https://docs.google.com/document/d/18sjiaxiYg-gn_O30ATnDaYq78bLhdCkNFquFaixCzHY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.f06f0jsy7k90 -- have standard prompts (should probably be in markdown files in github -- but do something with all the ways we reuse LLMs)
-  Determine plans for Grogo 
-  Determine plans for Fuqua pitch
-  Better workflow to run some background claude/cursor remotely cursor.com/agents for allowing YOLO -- build this whole app and take an hour or whatever
-  Getting my vibe code workflow down. Probably could use prompts better, lik ethe cursor vp of dev youtube video -- he's got a subset -- and just make sure it's always making passwords and shit easy, and that I learn how to do worktree and commits well
-  Perhaps do _something_ with https://commoncrawl.org/
-  Review if there's anything worth picking back up from SF retreat
-     Check Google Antigravity
- Regarding content calendar: reminder to reuse past things
- Look into RIF competitors and if what we build for RIF, they could use
- Finalize content workflow on how to do so efficientlly, super systematic, all the steps, including asking people to like.
- Host events in SF at our office, target is prospective clients, non-technical, maybe we can have a good use case for each of the subcategories of our things by then, and record somehow (with tripod) and add that to content on the page – and offer it for low-cost for local organizations maybe – would be good for content 
- 	Need to do a Labs project that shows meaningful AI and maybe some really slick front-end stuff so we can show people it as case study
-  Why were models trained on all of the internet and not just books and newspapers? Not even digitized data? Internet’s better? Seems there’s enough data, and better quality/structured in books/newspapers, but probably not as digitally accessible?

## Research & Learning

**Topics to deepen knowledge - move research items here**

| Topic | Output/Outcome/Use Case |
|-------|-------------------------|
| Cost optimization for RAG at scale | Reduce costs when expanding to millions of messages, inform client pricing |
| Embedding strategies (local vs API) | Choose best approach for different project sizes/budgets |
| Chunking strategies for RAG | Improve retrieval quality, handle context preservation |
| ReAct agent architecture | Build autonomous agents that reason and take action |
| Private/fine-tuned models | Understand feasibility and cost for client-specific models |
| Evals | Understanding/describing/using |
| Why front-end code is harder | Need to better understand why we can't show a figma and it build that easily |

## Marketing & Content

How to really fully maximize content reach when creating a piece, and how to be thoughtful of how to ensure we optimize sharing

How to processize this and make sure I or someone follows this each time we create content

Remember to post to all possible places:

- Bureau
- Founder’s Club
- Alliance of CEOs (maybe that’s just LinkedIn)
- Any other Slack communities? 
- Any other AI / local SF stuff?
- Shack 15 WhatsApp
- Should use Buffer to schedule
- Should schedule Slack messages for internal
